# SMARTIES package

**SMARTIES** (Spin MAp Reduction Toolkit for systematics Impact EStimation) is the re-implementation and extension of the map-based approach described in [McCallum et al. (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/513/3/3610/6541854) to simulate systematics at the map-level. 

The package is still a WORK IN PROGRESS, with its validation against equivalent TOD simulations actively being worked on. 
Documentation and more in-depth tutorial cases are coming in the near future, as well as code formatter to homogenize the current code written.
